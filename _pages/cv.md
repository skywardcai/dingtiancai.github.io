Education
======

* M.S. in Biostatistics, University of Miami, 2022
* B.S. in Biology, University of Miami, 2021

Work experience
======
* 2022-2025: Biostatistician
  * Hussman Institute for Human Genomics, University of Miami
  * Duties includes: 
    * Analyzed educational attainment and APOE ε4 interactions in 732 Puerto Rican participants, identifying cognitive resilience patterns through plasma pTau181 biomarker profiling and functional outcome assessments
    * Investigated regional disparities in educational attainment in 1445 African participants (Western/Eastern), linking higher education levels to reduced cognitive health diagnoses via Wilcoxon analyses and logistic regression modeling
    * Utilized logistic regression and chi-square analyses to identify employment stability and housing security as protective factors against dementia in 1,229 African participants
    * Conducted multinational cohort study analyzing stress-AD relationship in Black Americans, Hispanic, and Africans 
    * Investigated stress impacts on Alzheimer’s Disease in 328 Black Americans, Hispanic, and Africans, employing binomial regression to demonstrate a protective association between low stress and non-cognitive impairment
    * Developed the Culturally Attuned and Responsive Engagement (CARE) Model across 1,487 Black American, Hispanic, and African participants, leveraging semi-structured interviews and item response theory to design a culturally sensitive Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) instrument
    * Explored social engagement (SE) as a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer’s Disease in 1,018 African case-control participants, employing conditional logistic regression to demonstrate that low adult SE increased AD risk, while daily radio listening conferred robust protection
  * Supervisor: Eden R. Martin, Farid Rajabli, Kara Hamilton-Nelson

* 2021-2022: Research Assistant
  * Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami
  * Duties included: 
    * Conducted real-time UV exposure monitoring among Florida firefighters, quantifying dose-response relationships between occupational risks and sociodemographic factors 
    * Measured serum levels of 7 PFAS congeners in 208 Florida firefighters via mass spectrometry
  * Supervisor: Min Lu, Alberto J. Caban-Martinez
